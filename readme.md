# Your task: 
1. Modify the Course class so that you can add 
students and teachers to it.

2. Display all the teachers and students associated
with a course which will not use enhanced for loops on the 
student or teacher objects (unless they are part of the course). You should be able to list all students
and teachers for a course by using enhanced for loops on ONLY the course objects
you create.
